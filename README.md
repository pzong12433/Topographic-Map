# Topographic-Map
This was a project I created during my freshman year that utilizes MATLAB to create a topographic map.
By importing two spreadsheets(one with altitude values and the other with the presence of geographical obstructions) you are able to create a color-coded topographic map from the data as well as find the distance between the lowest and highest point.
